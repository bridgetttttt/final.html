        <h2> Pet Photography Tips and Tricks </h2>
        <p>
            Great pet photography is about volume. You’ll need to take lots of pictures,
            and there will be plenty of duds, but among all those pics will be some gems.
            Here are more professional pet photography tips:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get down to your pet's level. Crouch down or lie on the floor rather
                than taking the photo from high overhead. And try a few shots where you 
                get in close. If your pet is apt to back away, move in gradually
                with a treat or use a telephoto lens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Focus on the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. Sounds corny
                but focusing on your pet's eyes can help create an emotional connection
                with your viewer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid busy backgrounds. Be thoughtful about what’s behind and 
                    around your pet. You want your pet to be the center of attention.
                    Plain white walls, a large patch of green grass, or a light or dark
                    solid carpet to contrast your pet’s coat are all great options.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use natural light.  Lots of natural light is best for pets who
                    may get skittish around a flash. You can take photos of your dog 
                    outside or of your cat near a big sunny window.
                </li>
            </ul>
